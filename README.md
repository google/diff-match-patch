The Diff Match and Patch libraries offer robust algorithms to perform the
operations required for synchronizing plain text.

1. Diff:
   * Compare two blocks of plain text and efficiently return a list of differences.
   * [Diff Demo](https://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/demos/diff.html)
2. Match:
   * Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a block of plain text. Weighted for both accuracy and location.
   * [Match Demo](https://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/demos/match.html)
3. Patch:
   * Apply a list of patches onto plain text. Use best-effort to apply patch even when the underlying text doesn't match.
   * [Patch Demo](https://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/demos/patch.html)

Originally built in 2006 to power Google Docs, this library is now available in C++, C#, Dart, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Lua, Objective C, and Python.

### Languages
Although each language port of Diff Match Patch uses the same API, there are some language-specific notes.

A standardized speed test tracks the [relative performance of diffs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zpZccuBpjMZTvL1nGDMKJc7rWL_m_drF4XKOJvB27Kc/edit#gid=0) in each language.

### Algorithms
This library implements [Myer's diff algorithm](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/myers.pdf) which is generally considered to be the best general-purpose diff. A layer of [pre-diff speedups and post-diff cleanups](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/) surround the diff algorithm, improving both performance and output quality.

This library also implements a [Bitap matching algorithm](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/patch/bitap.ps) at the heart of a [flexible matching and patching strategy](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/patch/).
